Notes -
🔵 even top spotify track can be wrong, switch to official api to match from top "n" tracks

Currently working on -
🟡 lrclib provides lyrics inconsistently(sometimes does, sometimes does not)
🟡 fix lrclib, make lrclib fetch robust to network issues 

To work on -
🔴 apply best coding practices, normalize and optimize the codebase, add documentation
🔴 add single source of truth(s)
🔴 add option to auto embed lyrics to tracks 
🔴 add source: lyricfind
🔴 switch to official spotify api when developer dashboard app creation becomes available(speed up)

Finished working on -
🟢 use all sources together 
🟢 use relative paths 
🟢 move config to project root
🟢 best lyrics item match - reject if title, artist, album doesn't match
🟢 add lead lyrics utility function
🟢 cache unsynced lyrics if found to avoid double fetch
🟢 maybe switch from selenium to playwright?
🟢 add source - JioSaavn
🟢 automatically grab and cycle spotify auth token every 55 mins.
